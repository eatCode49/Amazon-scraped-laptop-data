Hi,
I am a python developer specelize on web scraping, Selenium and focused on automation
and data analyst. Are you a business, marketer, or researcher who needs 
**real-time Amazon laptop data** — prices, ratings, reviews — in an organized format?

✅ I've built a custom **Python web scraping tool** that extracts exactly what you need from Amazon.
Also I can build your own custom script for specific work.

## 💡 What You Get

This script automatically collects:

- 🖥️ **Laptop Name**
- 💲 **Price**
- 🔗 **Product URL**

All data is saved in a **clean CSV file** — ready for Excel, Google Sheets, or your own dashboard.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- `requests` – for fast page downloads  
- `selenium`- to get the html files 
- `BeautifulSoup4` – for clean HTML parsing  
- `pandas` – to organize data into tables
- `CSV` output – ready to use

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or request the `.py` file from me
2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
